The installer manifest used to build installer packages is a YAML document that
stores metadata related to the software to be installed in order to support the
generation of SWID tags and the installation of software on a target machine.

As a JSON document is also a valid YAML document, these manifests may also be in
the JSON format. This is useful for easier generation of the manifest by the
backend of the system

A simple example manifest file is shown below:
---
manifest:
  software: Hello Washington
  version: 1.0.0
  architecture: x86-64
  language: en-US
  publisher: BloSS@M
  os:
    type: linux
    distro: ubuntu
    version: 20.04
  needsKey: true
  assets:
    - helloWashington: /usr/local/bin
  keyInstall: /etc/hellowashington/license.key
---

The root of the YAML document is a map named manifest. There are various fields
that are required in this map. The software's title is given by the key
"software", its version number is given by the key "version", and so on.
The "software", "version", "architecture", "language", and "architecture" keys
are required for generating SWID tags. The "needsKey", "assets", and
"keyInstall" keys are required for the installer.
