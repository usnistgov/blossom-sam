The installer manifest used to build installer packages is a YAML document that
stores metadata related to the software to be installed in order to support the
generation of SWID tags and the installation of software on a target machine.

As a JSON document is also a valid YAML document, these manifests may also be in
the JSON format. This is useful for easier generation of the manifest by the
backend of the system

A simple example manifest file is shown below:
---
manifest:
  software: Hello Washington
  version: 1.0.0
  architecture: x86-64
  language: en-US
  publisher: BloSS@M
  os:
    type: linux
    distro: ubuntu
    version: 20.04
  needsKey: true
  assets:
  - filename: helloWashington
    dest: /usr/local/bin
    owner: root:root
    permissions: 0755
  keyInstall: /etc/hellowashington/license.key
---

The root of the YAML document is a map named manifest. There are various fields
that are required in this map. The software's title is given by the key
"software", its version number is given by the key "version", and so on.
The "software", "version", "architecture", "language", and "architecture" keys
are required for generating SWID tags. The "needsKey", "assets", and
"keyInstall" keys are required for the installer.

Each element in the "assets" array *must* have at least the following fields:
- filename: the name of the file in the installer package
- dest: the directory to install the file in
- owner: the user/group that should be marked as the owner of the file
- permissions: the POSIX permission bits for the file
Optionally the following fields may be present:
- destFilename: the name that the file should be installed as in the destination
  directory. If blank, the file should have the same filename as it does in the
  installer package.
