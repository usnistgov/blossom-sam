Software Assets Management for BloSS@M

---
## Our Goal
This project is supporting the usnistgov/blossom project (currently private), which aims to demonstrate, through a proof of concept application, the applicability of permissioned distributed ledger system to support the President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and the Quality Service Management Offices (QSMO) missions by enabling the upwards aggregation of software assets acquisition at USG level and downwards distribution, sharing and recycling of these software assets among different USG departments and agencies. Additionally, the project aims to demonstrate that the blockchain-based system created to address the PMA meets the Federal Information System Management Act (FISMA) requirement while automating a large percentage of the assessment and authorization (A&A) process to ease the system’s Authorization to Operate  (ATO) and to support continuous monitoring process. The outcome of the project, the Blockchain-based Secure Software Assets Management (BloSS@M), will be an implementation of a fully decentralized, intrusion-tolerant software assets management system leveraging multiple novel techniques (e.g., permissioned blockchains, SWID tag, NGAC). The permissioned blockchain system has unique properties, including high throughput and scalability and modular design and implementation.
